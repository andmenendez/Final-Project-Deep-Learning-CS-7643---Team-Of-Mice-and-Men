## Overview
Behavior classifications are difficult and complex problems as the differences between two behaviors can be unnoticeable to even trained scientists. These identifications become particularly difficult when labeling video data as itâ€™s very difficult for a human to determine when one behavior begins and ends on a frame-by-frame basis. Deep neural networks can solve this classification issue as they are more consistent and are unequivocally faster than any human. With a plethora of different available modules and tools, it can be difficult to design and train the right architecture for the right model. These networks will have to take into account the temporal nature of this behavior classification as a single behavior can best be identified through its context and not solely concerning a single frame. 

For more information about the implementation, please refer to the [paper](https://github.com/andmenendez/Final-Project-Deep-Learning-CS-7643---Team-Of-Mice-and-Men/blob/main/Final_Project_CS_7643.pdf).
